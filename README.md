## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Favorite apps: Spotify, Tik Tok, AMEX
Spotify - tapping the main buttons at the bottom to get back to the main screens. 
Tik Tok - The ease of sharing videos with friends and family
AMEX - The swiping feature between cards and accounts. 

App Idea - I would like to create an app that would help my mom and dad communicate with their clients about their scheduled services and ways to pay through the app as well. Would have a calendar booking function, an area for potential services, a routing area to venmo, zelle, cash app etc. for ways to pay for the services. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was a bit confused with the Xcode UI but after some practice I got the hang of it.
